# Code for my personal website, built with Phoenix/Elixir
This is a work in progress. Eventually I'd like to fork this project and convert it into a generalized framework for writing simple blogs.

Here's a demo of where it stands currently:

## Roadmap
- Build out a contact page with social media links
- Render "About" page with a markdown template
- Allow for arbitrary nesting of blog posts: topic, sub-topic, sub-sub-topic... etc
- Optimize CSS for smaller screens
- Add a generic landing page for blog posts
