# Algorithms and Data Structures

As a self-taught dev, I've come to realize that many of the computer science fundamentals that are typically the focus of technical interviews just aren't something that you learn as part of a standard engineering job.  

This portion of my website is dedicated to my quest for improvement in the fundamental computer science topics of algorithms and data structures. In order to deepen my understanding of each algorithm and data structure, I'm endeavoring to implement each topic in languages that I feel represent three of the common programming language paradigms that I've found myself working with: scripting paradigm, C-style paradigm, and functional paradigm.

### Python: scripting paradigm
- Object oriented, but also well suited for scripting
- Supports inheritance
- Dynamically typed
- Mutable data structures
- Interpreted

To me, Python represents the paradigm of dynamically typed, interpreted scripting languages. Other popular choices could be JavaScript or Ruby.

### Go: C-style paradigm
- Object oriented
- No inheritance
- Statically typed
- Mutable data structures
- Fast, compiled
- Built-in CSP concurrency

Go is a well-liked, performant, and relatively new programming language that is syntactically similar to C but has built in garbage collection and memory safety.

### Elixir: functional paradigm
- Purely functional
- Dynamically typed
- Immutable data structures
- Built in Actor-model concurrency
- Pattern matching

Elixir is a relatively new, purely functional language. I've chosen to use it in my own work because of its excellent web framework, Phoenix, and because it's generally a pleasure to work with. Other choices could be Haskell, Scala, or really any other purely functional language.
